# OrgChart
Project for Internship

During my Internship, I created a web based Organization Chart. In the OrgChart, users can Add, Delete and update employees to suit their needs. The program was made using the C# and ASP.Net framework in Visual Studio 2013. This project also involved working on the front and backend of the application.

For this OrgChart, it shows some of the faculty at the Computer Science department in Columbus State University.

NOTE: When you download and open the project solution in Visual Studio, you will have to reinstall the AjaxControl Toolkit to get it to work. To do this just right click the solution in visual studio and select Manage NuGet Packages and searh for 'Ajax Control Toolkit'. Click Install and the program should then be able to compile when you run it.
